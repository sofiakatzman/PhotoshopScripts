/* At time of script launch a few assumptions are made: 

- File structure is as required - as detailed in README.md 
- The designer has the color code for the background color handy.
- ? The designer knows what mockups are needed

FLOW: 
- designer creates folder as required 
- designer opens photoshop and runs script
- A dialog box asks the user to select required folder
- ? A dialog box asks the user to use a checkbox to select the mockups being required * 
- The dialog then asks the user for a Hex color code for the background color (necessary for the collection page hero assets)
- PSD creates mockups for each category. 
- Mockups are saved in the output folder 
- Dialog box confirms complete - user can click ok to exit out. 
- User can now use mockups as necessary
